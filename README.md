 Hi, Iâ€™m Dragos Arsene, a third-year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Technische Universiteit Delft. My main interests as a computer scientist are Algorithm Design, Deep Learning Networks, Computer Graphics(Ray Tracing) and Big Data processing(using Functional Programming).
- Java, C++, Python and Scala are my main tools of choice when I am working on a project. Other than that I have a basic to intermediate understanding of Assembly, JavaScript,
NodeJS and SQL.
- I also have experience with working in teams of 5-6 people on education-related projects as part of my university curriculum. After working on those projects, I am able to use frameworks(eg. Spring Boot or ASP.NET), create and manage databases(eg. H2 or Oracle), create servers and endpoints(either Monolith or Microservice Architecture) and use Version Control(git).
This repository will be specifically used to add any tools, programs or small projects I have used or created in the past.
