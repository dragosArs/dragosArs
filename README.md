- Hi, Iâ€™m Dragos Arsene, a second year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Technische Universiteit Delft.
- My main interests as a computer scientist are: Algorithm Design, Deep Learning Networks, Computer Graphics(Ray Tracing) and Big Data processing(using Functional Programming).
- Java, C++, Python and Scala are my main tools of choice when I am working on a project. Other than that I have a basic to intermediate understanding of Assembly, JavaScript,
NodeJS and SQL.
- I also have experience with working with teams of 5-6 people on education-related projects from my university. After working on those prjects, I am able to use frameworks
(Spring Boot), create and manage databases(using H2), create servers and ways to communicate between them(Microservice Architecture) and use Version Control(git).
- This repository will be specifically used to add any tools, programs or small projects i have used pr created in the past.
